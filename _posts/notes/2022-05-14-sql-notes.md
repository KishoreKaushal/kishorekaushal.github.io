My notes for SQL.

## CRUD Operations

SQL is not case sensitive.

`USE` -- Select a database for use.

```sql
USE database_name;
```

`SELECT` -- Retrieve data from a table.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... 
FROM table_name;
```

`SELECT *` -- Retrieve all columns from a table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```


`DISTINCT` -- Retrieve distinct "projections" from the given select statement.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

`WHERE` -- Filter the projections with the given condition. This clause is also used with `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition; 
```

`AND`, `OR` and `NOT` clause can be combined with `WHERE`.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition1 AND condition2 OR condition3 ...;
```

`ORDER BY` -- Sort the result-set in ascending or descending order specified by `ASC` or `DESC`.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

`INSERT INTO` -- Insert new records in a table.

> No insert is possible if it violates any constraint.

2 ways:-

```sql
/* specify both the column names and values to be inserted */ 
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

/* also possible to only insert data in specified columns */
/* this is only possible when other fields can accept null values */
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');
```

```sql
/* specify the values in order */ 
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

`NULL` -- A field with no value.

Checking for `NULL` value.

`IS NULL` -- to test for empty values.
`IS NOT NULL` -- to test for non-empty values.

```sql
/* Conditions for null values */
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

`UPDATE` -- statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

```sql
/* this updates all the row which satisfy the condition */
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

Dangerous `UPDATE` statement.

```sql
/* this will update all rows in the table */
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='+91-99XXXXXXXX'
```

`DELETE` -- to delete rows in a table which satisfy a condidion.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

/* dangerous statement - all records will be deleted */
DELETE FROM table_name;
```

`SELECT TOP` -- used to specify number of records to return. This is useful on large tables with millions of records, because retrieving very large number of rows can cause performance issues. This clause is available with `LIMIT` name in many SQLs. Oracle used `FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY` and `ROWNUM`.

Here we will discuss `MariaDB` syntax.

```sql
/* 2 variations of LIMIT */
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT offset, row_count
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset
```

## Functions

- `MIN()`
- `MAX()`

```sql
/* return minimum of all values in column_name which satisfy condition */
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `COUNT()` - returns number of rows that matches a specified condition
- `AVG()` - returns the average value of all value that matches a specified condition
- `SUM()` - returns the sum of all value that matches a specifies condition


## Conditional Operators

`LIKE()` search a specified pattern in a column

- `%` matches any number of characters, including zero.

- `_` matches any single character.

- `ESCAPE` characters are used in the pattern string to indicate that any wildcard character that occurs after the escape character in the pattern string should be treated as a regular character. Default escape character is backslash `\`.


```sql
<select expr> [NOT] LIKE pattern [ESCAPE `escape_char`]

/* examples */
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE "___day";
```

`IN` or `NOT IN` operator compares a value with a list of values: 

```sql
<expression> [NOT] IN (v1, v2, v3, ...)

/* nested select statement */
<expression> [NOT] IN (<select-statement>)
```

example:

```sql
select name, region_id
from countries
where region_id not in (1,2,3);

select name, region_id
from countries
where region_id in (
    select region_id
    from regions
    where name like '%Asia%'
)
order by name;
```

`BETWEEN` compares values within a given range (inclusive).

```sql
/* value can be numeric, date, characters */
<expression> [NOT] BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

/* numeric example */
select name, area 
from countries
where area not between 1566500 and 2780400
order by area;

/* date example */
select name, national_day 
from countries
where national_day between '1945-08-17' and '1953-11-09'
order by national_day;
```
